## Synopsis

This Python code makes a connection with the F4S/D series controller manufactured by
Watlow (Winona, Minnesota, USA). 

## Motivation

The aim is that the temperature chamber user can quickly define a temperature recipe
by implementing this code and the potential of data-collection in automatic or
semi-automatic fashion.

## Web resources 

This code uses MinimalModbus for computer-hardware connection.
It is an easy-to-use Python module for talking to instruments (slaves) from a computer
(master) using the Modbus protocol.
