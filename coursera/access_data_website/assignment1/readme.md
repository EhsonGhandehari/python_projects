# Introduction

The purpose of this project was to write a few line code in Python that is capable to scrape the text from a website in a quick fashion.
In this code, I used **Socket** package in order to connect my code to the Internet.
The overall goal here was to familiarize myself with data mining process.

This repo consists of two Python files:

1.  socket_data_minning: Which scrapes the text (metadata and body) of the provided html website, and writes it into the "output.txt" file.
2.  text_integer_summation: Which mines the "output.txt" file, finds all the integers, and prints the final summation.
